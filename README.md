## Title
Gourmand<br>

## Introduction
As computers and technological advancement have become part of life for accessing almost any kind of information. Too bad if we live without utilizing technology. In todayâ€™s age of fast food and take-out, most of us in IIUM focus on speedy delivery of orders. Until very recently, all of these delivery orders were placed over the phone through **WhatsApp**. <br>

What we propose is an online ordering system, which is a technique of ordering foods online applicable in any food around IIUM. The main advantage of the system is that it greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the rider. It also allows the customer to customize their order into what they want.


## Objective
+ To ease of collecting order form user
+ User able to customize their order


## Features
As we develop an online ordering method, the key benefit of the method is that it significantly simplifies the ordering process for the user. After signing in to the apps by entering their credentials, directly they are able to add their order. If they are unhappy about their order, they can simply customize the order that is done into what they want. The changes they made will automatically save and update the database. This is to ensure the order integrity.


## Functionalities
The main functionalities are to make ordering and delivering orders for food easier for food runners. The customers are able to add their orders to the apps and this makes the job easier for the rider as the order is collected into one place, in the apps. What separates us from common methods of ordering  (which use **WhatsApp**), is Gourmand offers the user or the customer to customize their order into what they want.
